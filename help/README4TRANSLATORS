- To create a new translation run from this directory:

mkdir XX (where XX is the code of the language you are going to translate)
cp C/legal.xml XX/
xml2po C/gnome-mastermind.xml > XX/XX.po
edit the po file

- To update a new translation:

backup the old po file (mv XX.po XX.po.bk)
xml2po C/gnome-mastermind.xml > XX/XX.pot
msgmerge XX.po.bk XX.pot > XX.po
edit the new po file

- To make localized screenshots (from top dir) 
CFLAGS=-DSSHOT ./autogen.sh
make

LANGUAGE=XX src/gnome-mastermind

A localized window with a completed game will appear, simply take a shot
of it saving it to XX/figures/mainwindow.png
